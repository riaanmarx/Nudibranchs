            <span class="head1">Origin &amp; purpose of the site:</span><br />
            This site was created to satisfy the need for a portable, living, geographically-specific list of opistobranch species.<br />The recent wave of genera name
            changes and movements highlighted the need for an identification resource that is easy to update and accessable to nudibranch-enthusiasts.<br />
        </p>

            <span class="head1">Photos</span><br />

Ownership remains with the photographer in question and you are kindly requested to get permission from them prior to reproducing or using the images.

            Yes, I am human, and no I am not the foremost expert on all things nudibranch. I am an IT nerd who happens to dive and love to hunt nudibranchs with my underwater camera rig.<br />
            I try to ensure the information listed here is correct and complete, but lets face it - an error or omition may(will) slip in at some point.<br />
            Please accept my appologies in advance and - instead of making a fuss about it - let me know so I can fix it.<br />
            Also, please understand the site is still in its infancy and I am at this point still making lots of changes.<br />
